If you need to run the autopilot for the first time go to README.md and follow the instructions



Start Lecroy Scope listener:
	1) ssh -XY daq@timingdaq01.dhcp.fnal.gov. Don't source any setup script.
	2) Go to ~/SurvivalBeam2021/JARVIS/BackEndProcesses/
	3) Open readLecroyScopeStatus.py and adjust the scope acquisition parameters.
	4) Through remote desktop make sure the scope is ready for acquisition
	5) Now start the listener using
	 		python readLecroyScopeStatus.py



Run AutoPilot:

1) Make configurations on AirTable for each device.
2) Make global configuration pointing to every device config.
3) If the listeners on different digitizers are not running, follow the listener starting procedures.
4) Make sure the otsdaq webpage says that it is in configured state. If not follow the otsdaq configuring procedures.
5) Make sure the otsdaq is correctly configured for all the digitizers in the otsdaq webpage configuration.
6) Now to run the autopilot, assuming you are already on timingdaq02:
		Go to JARVIS/AutoPilot
		source ~/setup.sh
		./runAutoPilot.sh <Global Configuration number>  <number of runs to take>	example: ./runAutoPilot.sh 1 10

Stop AutoPilot:

1) Go to JARVIS/AutoPilot on timingdaq01. 
2) Run ./StopAutoPilot.sh
